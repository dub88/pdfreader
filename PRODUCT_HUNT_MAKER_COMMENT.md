# Product Hunt - Maker's Comment (Draft)

**Title**: PDF Speaker - Listen to your PDFs with Siri's Premium Voices (Offline & Private)

**Maker's Comment**:

Hey hunters! 👋 I'm Matt, and I built **PDF Speaker** because I was tired of two things:
1.  Paying $20/month for text-to-speech subscriptions.
2.  Privacy concerns with cloud-based TTS services.

I realized that my Mac already has world-class neural voices (the same ones Siri uses) built-in, but there was no good "reader-friendly" app to leverage them. 

PDF Speaker is a native macOS app that lets you turn any PDF into a high-quality audiobook instantly. 

**Why it's different:**
*   **Zero Subscriptions**: Buy it once, own it forever. It uses your native Mac voices, so it works completely offline.
*   **Synchronized Highlighting**: A yellow "focus frame" follows the reading progress paragraph-by-paragraph, which is a game-changer for people with ADHD or those who learn better while reading along.
*   **Bookmarks with Notes**: Don't just listen—interact. Save bookmarks with custom notes to mark important sections for later review.
*   **Clean Voice Management**: Preview any voice instantly and hide the ones you'll never use. Focus on the premium neural voices that make reading a joy.
*   **Smart Cleaning**: It doesn't just read the raw text. It intelligently skips headers, footers, and page numbers, and fixes common "PDF-isms" like broken line breaks and ligatures.
*   **Privacy First**: Your documents never leave your machine. Period.

I’m launching this today because I want to make high-quality accessibility tools affordable for everyone. Whether you're a student, a researcher, or just someone who wants to "read" while doing chores, I'd love for you to try it out.

I’ll be here all day to answer questions and listen to your feature requests! 

**Special Launch Offer**: I've set the price to just $19 (one-time) for the PH community today.

Happy listening! 🎧
